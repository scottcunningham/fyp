                            So the current model of the "internet" is really very centralised.
                            Users connect to their ISP, internet service provider, and from there onwards
                            they connect to a web server to get content.
                            Websites themselves are also very centralised: often it is the case that
                            websites are hosted online by one specific web server who serves all the users.
                            This can be scaled up to many servers but the same principles really apply:
                            still centralised.
                            This centralisation makes sense in some ways: for example, it's simple to organise,
                            and seems to be efficient

                         Our problem space is really the centralisation that's prevalent around the internet.
                        DNS, which is used to resolve domain names, is said to be centralised but really
                        it's controlled by central authorities and if you're relying on your ISP's DNS then
                        they can cut you off.
                        Since a website is hosted at a known IP address, 3rd parties snooping on your traffic
                        (through ISPs or intermediate routers etc) can correlate the IP address you connec tto
                        with the sites that this IP address serves.
                        This means that websites have a single point of failure: the content is in one known place.
                        This means that, say, for example, the case of Wikileaks
                        they were a single server or a small set of servers, and
                        powerful governments who did not agree with their content were able to temporarily shut
                        them down by using a DDoS attack on that one server.
                        Censorship is prevalent through much of the world.
                        For example: well-known sites for downloading copyrighted media is banned in Ireland,
                        thepiratebay
                        Turkey's government also bans social media
                        The notable thing here is that it's the governments banning these websites

                        My aim is to design and create an alternative model for a web serving network that should
                        shortcomings in the classic internet model
                        We want to achieve five main goals:
                        - Allow for people to post anonymously.
                        You can imagine a political dissident publishing an anti-government paper
                        - Reader privacy:
                        Make it impossible for third parties on the network to determine what a certain user is accessing
                        - Secure data storage
                        In my proposed model, a user's data - in this case, webpages - is to be held by other users in the
                        network. We need to be able to confirm without doubt that data has not been tampered with,
                        that it is the original content that the author wrote
                        - We want to exploit the linking nature of the web
                        By this, I mean that we want this network to work well as a web experience, not just simple data
                        storage. Users should be able to link to other sites from their own, just like in the WWW now.
                        - Community driven censorship.
                        We want to put censorship into the hands of the people, for the decision to block a harmful website
                        to be done democratically by the users of the website.
                        We want to avoid any large centralised authority being in control of what is and isn't shown in the network:
                        it should be completely based on the users' opinion.

                        in their censorship, Russia for example

                    Is all censorship bad?
                    Existing solutions to the censorship problem in this area include FreeNet and Tor.
                    FreeNet and Tor are known for their strong opinions against censorship:
                    Tor, for example, has its main purpose in avoiding tracking and any sort of censorship.

                    However, I think it would be naive to say that censorship is objectively bad.
                    In some cases, censorship is very justified, for example when a community reaches
                    a consensus that some content is harmful or unsuitable for consumption.

                    Since other solutions in this problem space take an extreme anti-censorship approach with
                    which I do not completely agree with, I ask the following questions:
                    Can we build censorship into the system design?
                    Can we design a system to enable democratic, user-driven censorship uncontrolled by large powers?

                        To achieve anonymity for users who want to publish a webpage to the network we publish the content
                        to a Kademlia network.
                        By doing this, the content is stored by other nodes in the network and not the publisher.
                        Then, the user doesn't hold their own data so they can't be associated with it.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Every page is identified by a completely random identifier, or called a uuid.
                        Since this identifier is random, it can't be used to identify anything but the site itself.
                        We use the uuid for two things:
                        - We put it through a hash function, like sha1 for example, to get a hashed location in the
                        kademlia network in which to store the data
                        - We also use a cryptographic technique called a Key Derivation Function which from the data
                        determenistically generates a cryptographic key that we use to encrypt the data

                        We also use a HMAC, hashed message authentication code, to encode integrity checks into the
                        content. This means that if data is tampered with then a user will know when they decrypt it

                        The nodes on the network only receive the encrypted data: they don't know the uuid
                        so they can't decrypt the webpage or figure out which URL it is for, and they can't tamper 
                        with it due to the HMAC
