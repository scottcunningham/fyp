# Week 4 notes

- Downvoting?
    * Inverse of "keep cos being used model"
* Every site naturally dies away
* Explicit downvotes mean that blah blah blah
* Partial anonymity?
    - Like if a bad site is uncovered, author is exposed
* Allow community to control what's kept in community
* If we allow everybody to publish anything, how do we stop things against the goals of the community?
* Note: imagine system like levacher w/ good people predicting bad sites get more points for censorship
    - we can do this by surrounding peers knowing they're good
    - we can also scope this out, just mention that it's a nice idea
* Revoking anonymity: probably can't be done technically while preserving rights
* Maybe think of mobile web??
    - like topic publish system
    - like bulletin boards
    - good for demo - makes it more concrete
    - eg anti-bully site - could help to scope it down
    - if it simplifies idea -> GOOD
* Pick some sort of system that has a LRU model for deletion?
* Make degrading model based on downvote over time
    - downvotes kick off a ttl, more downvotes - less ttl
    - volatile ttl based on how many people like it/etc

## TO-DO

- No more reading unless SPECIFIC QUESTION
- Establish absolute goals: anonymity, obtain author info?
- Define ETHICAL MODEL for the system
- Write up idealised model based on ETHICAL MODEL
- Implement some of it, scope things out/in
- After design done, try to implement some of it
- Do some implementation over next 4 weeks
- Send Stephen ~5 recent projects to see if he thinks they're good to model them on

## Graded on

* Quality of text, well-written
    - Am I telling story or gathering together of things - does it have a flow
* Technical challenge - was this hard/easy to do
    - If I can deliver solution to this, then good - hard to decentralise stuff
* Clear set of goals - do we have research question, what are we trying to do?
    - We want to keep content but want community to say what we want to keep
    - decentralise it
* Note: nobody takes demo seriously really...

## Meeting

- Monday after reading week
- Can do next Tuesday if necessary
- Write-up about 2 weeks after that
- Questions etc can go beforehand
