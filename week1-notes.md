# Notes from meeting

## Crypto
- Homomorphic encryption
- Secure multi-party encryption in general (SMP)
    - these 2 might not suffice: https://itsec.rwth-aachen.de/theses/evaluating-the-use-of-fully-homomorphic-encryption-in-secure-multi-party-computation
    - more info here
- Functional encryption
    - process over encrypted data such that key lets you evaluate subset of data

## Escrow
Like third party which can control data, determines revocation etc

## Data sovereignty
- Mediate, control access to data, ownership, etc
- Functional encryption relevant here

# To do:

- Next 2 weeks: figure out goals, set of restraints etc, meet up
- 1 week after: look at technologies to fit those restraints

- Read literature, make notes etc

- Goals wrt:
    * Anonymity, security, privacy (all different)
    * Publish w/o constraints

- SPECIFY WHAT WE WANT TO DELIVER

- Look at what a system might look like, design level, not impl

- Read
    * FYPs by Blanchfield - done
    * thesis by Kilian Levacher
