## Define what exactly we want to do

- A distributed web hosting and serving system
- Possibility of revocation/etc using an escrow system
- Anonymity: users can publish and not be tracked to that site

## Why an escrow?

- We COULD be totally impartial and ignore the contents of data we hold
- That's more like Tor
- Possibility of illegal or immoral content
- Has been done before, trying to be novel

## Ethical points

- Censorship on the internet is a "Bad Thing" and should be avoided
- The network should make possible political dissidents etc to post
- Some level of censorship is useful: eg, for hate speech/child pornography
- Majority rule on censorship seems like a good solution

## Research questions

- Is it possible to decentralise web hosting?
- What are the benefits of doing so?
- Is the increased cost worth doing so?
- Is the performance hit worth doing so?
- Is the increased complexity worth doing so?

## Goals

## Restraints

- We can assume that escrow is reliable, not corrupt
    - Not run by government etc but by 3rd party, or distributed
- People could be blocked from joining from one endpoint
    - Need to have an adaptive topology that can let users join even when their governments actively ban known IPs etc
