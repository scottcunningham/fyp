\section{Background}

\subsection{Hierarchical}

The current model of the world-wide web is hierarchical. Users typically
connect to the internet via an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
This gives Internet Service Providers the ability to analyse and block
traffic which passes through them. This ability can be used for censorship
of the users. Internet Service Providers typically use this ability to block
user access to web-sites.

\subsection{Censorship}

Web censorship is often put in place by Internet Service Providers in response
to pressure from organisations such as governments or large media establishments.
It is often the case that these organisations that impose this censorship on web
users act in their own best interests, and not always that of the users. This is
particularly true in the case of governments blocking external media sources in
an effort to maintain political or social goals that would be interfered with
by media from other countries. Research done by the OpenNet Institute ~\cite{opennet}
shows that internet censorship is done for political, social, and conflict/security
reasons. Since the validity of this type of censorship is subjective, we argue that
web censorship of this nature is not justifiable and that the web should be free
from this censorship.

It is not the case, however, that censorship is universally bad. In some cases,
censorship is a viable means of removing harmful content from the internet.
However, it is difficult for a third party to accurately define what content
can be deemed objectively harmful for users of a system. Therefore, we argue
that censorship should be decided only by consensus by the users of a system.

StackOverflow is a technical questions-and-answers website that features
community-driven content rating. StackOverflow is a where users can submit
questions about a topic, and other users can answer these questions. The quality
of answers is rated by users through a simple up-vote/down-vote system, where an
“up-vote” is used to signify that a user believes that this answer is appropriate,
and a “down-vote” is used when a user believes that an answer is inappropriate. ~\cite{stackoverflow}
The quality of an answer is assessed by its overall down-vote count subtracted
from its overall up-vote count. Answers are then sorted according to this
quality metric, and the answers are ordered by their score. In this way, the
community decides which answers are appropriate and most worthwhile, and their
consensus decides whether answers are shown or hidden from view.

\subsection{User Privacy}

Internet Service Providers also have the ability to record user browsing habits.
By analysing HTTP and HTTPS traffic sources destinations, they can identify web-sites
that their users are visiting.

SSL certificates, used for encryption when serving a web-site over HTTPS rely on a
centralised certificate-validation system. Due to the expense of SSL certificates,
much web traffic on the Internet uses the unencrypted HTTP protocol rather than the
encrypted HTTPS. This means that users web traffic is transmitted unencrypted: without
HTTPS, user passwords and web content can be read by malicious users on a shared network.

\subsection{Centralisation of hosting}

Web-sites hosting is usually centralised. It is typical for a website to be served by
one single web server which serves content to all of that web-site’s users. This leads
to a single-point-of-failure in web serving. Hardware or software failure at this server
will lead to a loss of service for this web-site. Attackers that can take this single web-server
down will result in a global failure of this web-site. This is often done through an attack
called a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).

\section{Goals}

This project aims to design an alternate model for web content delivery on the internet.
The model should aim to address privacy and anonymity issues in the current model.
The project goals are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item{Decentralisation \\
The system aims to avoid the centralisation that web-site hosting currently uses.
Decentralising the system means that no resources will be controlled by one centralised
authority, putting the system in the hands of the users themselves.
        }

    \item{Author Anonymity \\
Users who wish to publish content on this network must be able to do so anonymously.
Web content published to the network must not be traceable to the user that created it.
Users, then, can not hold their own content: it must be co-operatively held by other
users of the network in exchange for holding their content.
        }

    \item{Reader Privacy \\
Users who wish to consume content on this network must be able to do so with privacy.
It should be impossible for malicious users who intercept traffic on this network
(either via a shared connection or by being their ISP,  etc) should not be able to
determine what content a user is consuming.
        }

    \item{Community-Driven Censorship \\
Censorship is often controlled by large, centralised powers such as governments.
Due to this, it is not always the case that web users are in control of what content
has been made unavailable to users of the network. Users of the network should be
in control of what content is or is not acceptable.
        }

    \item{Increased reliability and redundancy \\
Web content stored on the network should not be reliant on any one single node.
Content should be spread across nodes to ensure that it remains on the network despite
single users leaving the network.
        }

    \item{Secure Data Storage \\
Users can not all hold their own data because this would violate a user’s anonymity,
so other users must hold it for them. As a result, we must ensure that the users storing
your web content can neither tamper with it nor read its contents. For them to do so could
possibly breach the author’s privacy. This necessitates secure data storage.
        }
\end{enumerate}

The system aims to provide author anonymity, publisher anonymity,
reader anonymity and document anonymity as defined by Blanchfield ~\cite{blanchfield}.
