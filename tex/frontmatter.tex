%We show how a systematic subtraction of the `special' components of a general
%deformation can be used to give an improved
%version of the `wall formula' estimate for $\mu(0)$.
%We believe this is the first study of $\omega$-dependent heating rate in
%billards, and the first consideration of the `special' nature of dilation.
